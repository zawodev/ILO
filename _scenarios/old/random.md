okay so i dont like showing my face for real to the point that i rather spend 6 hours making this deepfake of some young and really handsome men then actually showing up in front of a camera i think that says a lot about me... i like programming video edditing and working alone on my stuff, i have many crazy ideas, and i love finishing my projects more than starting new ones. i am well organised in my surroundings, but it may seem different to an outside observer because I am not usually present in the real world here and now but rather sitting in my head thinking about everything but not the present moment... i generally approach things with a prepared plan but more general than a specific one. and i also dont like to improvise so i wrote this whole thing and have repeated it several times. yup thats it guess my type
